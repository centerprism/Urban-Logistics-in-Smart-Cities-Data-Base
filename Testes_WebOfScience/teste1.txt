AB The urban logistic sector is struggling with the following two problems: a particularly high level of traffic and air pollution. For those reasons, small electric vehicles are the perfect technical solution to cope sustainably with the increasing parcel volume in urban areas. To compensate the weight disadvantage of electric drive, a textile lightweight solution for the body of logistics vehicles is examined in this study. Therefore, various textiles and mounting solutions are examined and developed, as well as tested by multiple testing procedures. The result of this work is an ideal combination of a textile and suitable mounting method for a textile lightweight body for last-mile logistic vehicles.

   infrastructure
AB In most European congested urban areas the rail tracks of the 19th and 20th century serving locations of industry and goods stations were removed, transformed for public passenger transport, closed down or used for other purposes. The main reasons might be the de-industrialisation of the inner cities and the centralisation of the supply-sector (wholesale markets, shopping centres). Simultaneous the urban areas got an excellent road network on the surface and an efficient public transport system in the underground or on dedicated tracks. Nevertheless the amount of goods delivered to urban areas increased due to material prosperity. In this context "METRO. FREIGHT. 2020" analysed the possibilities of a reinforced utilisation of railway infrastructure for freight transport on the first and the last miles within the urban regions in Austria as exemplified in case studies for the metropolitan Region of Vienna, the agglomerations of Graz and Linz and for the urbanised Rhine-Valley in Vorarlberg. In this context the focus point of consideration was the interface of transport and urban development, to a lesser extent the theoretical approach behind. As a fundamental milestone a cadastre of existing or recoverable sidings or other rail shipping points has been surveyed. They were evaluated in respect of serviceability concerning tracking freight trains in the rail network and extensibility in the service area which was complemented with propositions for further developing.
   The recommendations focus measures intending technically and economically operable access points to rail net on one hand and potentially appropriate access points for the future. But, to reach this goal more strengthened integration of commercial location policy and of shippers' transport demands with a coordinated land use planning and an infrastructure development policy is required. Finally the methodical approach elaborated comprises following components to push more rail freight shipping:
   Traffic zoning is a hierarchical spatial approach subdividing an urban region in sectors, zones and 'agglomerates' as spheres of activity for political and private actors involved in freight traffic generation and infrastructure affaires.
   Surveying a multimodal topology of infrastructure network which integrates all transport modes in its layout of freight infrastructure propped up on a public platform of a multimodal network graph in future.
   Characterizing an 'agglomerate' typology of shipping sites with affinity to rail which describes the typical initial position and development trends of the freight transport inducing traffic zones.
   Shaping spatial structures which consist of super structures of shipping industrial sites as traffic generators, the infrastructure with its capacity for freight movements and the 'metastructure'as external affected settlements and land uses are prime targets and intervention objects, the coordinated measures have to be allocated to.
   The railway operators are called on to offer more flexible train and operation forms tailored to the logistics of shippers if the rail infrastructure within the serving area from the consolidation node to the sidings enables it. In the end three scenarios have been identified, namely a scenario of ultimate displacement of rail freight service in towns, a retarding scenario which brakes the retreat of rail connected with a change of paradigm in transport and traffic planning leading into an offensive scenario of 'clean freight mobility' to revitalize and extend rail freight operations into areas of high consumption.

DE Activity chains; efficiency; duplicate activities
AB Many city logistic initiatives are large in scale and aim to improve the efficiency and overall state of goods movement within our urban areas. Unfortunately the implementation and day-to-day operations of urban goods movement is less than optimal. Commercial vehicles have many activities in their activity chains, from when they start at a terminal depot, until they return. Some vehicles have as many as hundreds of activities in a single chain. Unfortunately many consecutive activities in a vehicle's chain occur at the same facility, suggesting that vehicles have to maneuver and relocate a few times before their true, economically useful function is completed. In this study we consider such duplicate activities and perform temporal and spatial analyses to better understand the nature of these productivity sinks. (C) 2016 The Authors.

DE Decision makers; local authority; planning model; urban freight
   transport
AB Freight transport in urban areas is not as efficient as it could be. Since freight transport has a large proportion of emissions from traffic, this is an area that needs to be addressed by all actors involved. Freight transport has in recent years gained a more important role in urban planning in large cities in Europe. However, the medium and small cities also need to address the problem in the decision making process. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate how Swedish small and medium sized cities deal with urban freight transport and to frame the problem of urban freight transport planning from a local authority perspective. Interviews with and questionnaires to decision makers are the basis for the evaluation of the possibilities for countering the challenge. City logistic schemes implemented in a large city are not always suitable for a smaller city and maybe not even for another city of the same size. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. A process planning model is presented based on the results, which is a practical tool for local authority decision makers in their planning process, but it is also a theoretical contribution, valuable for future research in urban freight transport planning studies.

ID SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
AB Optimized urban logistics is an important issue for rapidly growing cities worldwide. Many criteria can be optimized in order to improve the performance of urban logistics. Economic and time dependent criteria are central but not the only ones; lately, sustainable criteria are becoming key and urgent due to new regulations and environmental concern of governments and the society. In this work we review the state of the art of intelligent developments and techniques that might aid to build smart and optimized urban logistic applications. Moreover, we propose a prototype platform conceived as a supporting and facilitating layer for the growing business of last mile delivery (LMD) companies that operate in cities in an isolated way. Our vision is to provide a cooperative intelligent platform that provides coordination and collaboration services for the LMD companies of urban areas.

AB Logistics platforms and reverse logistics are the most used solutions addressing daily problems in urban areas such as noise, pollution and cost. Their main goal is to ensure sustainable development in modern cities. The paper proposes an approach based on forward and reverse flows in urban logistic. To that end, we present a location-allocation of logistics platforms in a reverse logistics system. We, then, locate allocation and evaluate their effect on logistic platforms. In doing so, we present a mathematical model of the city logistics platform to specify location-allocation problem. Our model considers both flows: urban freight and reverse logistics. Subsequently, we improve city logistics platform's financial situation by reducing operating costs. Finally, we use a numerical algorithm for optimization and illustration purposes.

AB This paper investigates the opportunity to plan for a novel on-demand freight delivery service in urban areas with tight service and sustainability requirements. This contribution first attempts to focus on the feasibility of connecting people and freight mobility through the joint usage of transportation options. It builds on the hyperconnectivity principles enabled by the Physical Internet (PI) manifesto for city logistics, referred to as HCL (Hyperconnected City Logistics). To this end, this paper proposes a model-based decision support approach that seeks to produce effective delivery solutions for an on-demand multimodal transshipment problem. The approach considers multiple mobility options such as on-demand urban delivery services, cargo bikes, tramways, and buses to transship goods from one urban logistic hub to another. This novel shortterm response planning problem complements the well-known day-before planning problem. The objective function aims to minimize the impact of freight moves in the time and space of urban transport networks. The proposed solution aims to increase the sustainability of cities by reducing congestion levels, the impact of logistics moves, as well as carbon emissions in urban areas. An illustrative case is provided to demonstrate how the novel multi -mode transportation system could operate and to provide an evaluation of the economic and sustainability benefits of such a system in an urban context. For a hyperconnected network, the impact of freight movements on the time and space of urban transport networks can be reduced by 91%. The results demonstrate the potential of urban synchromodality in improving economic efficiency, service capability, and sustainability.

AB The objective of this work is to propose a model for evaluating the performance of city logistics by questioning the relationship between the stakeholders involved, key performance factors in terms of efficiency and responsiveness, and urban parameters. The study is of the quantitative exploratory-descriptive type, using auto-administered cross-sectional survey procedure, in which the questionnaire question instrument is available online. The agents classified as shippers were questioned and the data obtained were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) based on Partial Least Squares (PLS) through Smartpls (R) software. Five hypotheses were tested, in which the involved stakeholders factor in the SEM model was not statistically significant in relation to the performance of city logistics, pointing to the need for attention to this in terms of the strategic alignment from a new definition of the agents covered in the distribution of goods in the urban area. In addition, 56.4% of the variance in the city logistic performance variable was explained by the model.

AB With 25% of CO2 transport-related emissions, urban freight mobility is a relevant cause of climate change. Its optimization is a main aim of the Sustainable Urban Logistic Plans. Currently, the CO2 analysis of such plans is mostly based on a Tank-To-Wheel approach, which does not consider fuel production and distribution, thus not providing a comprehensive evaluation of its carbon effects. In this paper, we propose an alternative two-step approach: after quantifying CO2 emissions through a Well-To-Wheel methodology, which assesses the entire energy pathway of the fuel, we valuate them economically, using a meta-analysis of 700 studies. We test this model to assess the carbon potentialities of a new Urban Consolidation Centre (UCC) in the city of Lucca, Italy. Our results indicate a potential yearly saving of up to 190 tCO(2) (which corresponds to about 10,000 of social cost savings). These benefits are mostly obtained through third funds, which make the investment financially sustainable for the municipality. With adequate adaptations, the model can be used in other urban areas to assess the carbon potentiality of different transport measures. Furthermore, an integration of the long-distance freight movement can provide the total CO2 contribution of freight transport. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the context of research project MOSCA (MOSCA: Decision Support System for Integrated Door-To-Door Delivery: Planning and Control in Logistic Chains, IST 2000-29557), promoted by the European Union, a prototype of a wcb-based support tool (web-portal) was developed. Its purpose was to improve communication and coordination between participants of the traffic system. These participants were divided into two segments: the supply-side and the demand-side. The supplyside consists of cities and municipalities which "supply" the traffic infrastructure. On the other hand, the senders and receivers of goods (companies, stores) use ("demand") this traffic infrastructure, The starting point is the rising extent of utilization or the traffic system in urban areas, which today has already reached its capacity limits. In order to work against this, the city of Lugano in Switzerland examined whether it is meaningful to limit the entry of trucks into the city. Only vehicles that can show proof of an existing parking bay will be granted admission to the city center. Thereby the possibility of dynamic pricing of parking areas and the assignment of parking bays by means of auctions were investigated. The suggested web-portal represents a technical possibility to implement such an access restriction. By publishing information of open capacities, all participants are able to realize more efficient plans of city-logistic activities in dense populated areas, since this information can be used in logistic planning algorithms.

AB Although urban freight transport is a significant contributor to the development of a country, it has adverse effects on the environment and the quality of life in urban areas. To reduce these adverse effects, we can deploy sustainable city logistic strategies. Scheduling and routing of vehicles is a crucial decision in city logistic strategies. Hence, in this paper, we solve the Multi-Depot Two Echelon Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (MD2E-CVRP), which is a variant of Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with heterogeneous fleets at both levels. Since VRP is NP-hard, we have proposed a Simulated Annealing (SA) based heuristic solution algorithm and have tested it on the standard 2E- CVRP and MD2E-CVRP instances. The results obtained from SA have a good solution quality at just one-fiftieth of computational time using CPLEX and was found to be faster than Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) with only a marginal drop in solution quality.

AB According to estimates from 2010, the Canton of Sarajevo has about 465,000 inhabitants. City logistics centers are normally formed in all cities with more than 300,000 inhabitants. City logistics centers based on traffic and favorable locations on the periphery of cities or in the metropolitan area and connect the input and output streams, coordinate the flow of goods in the supply and the transportation of the urban area. This paper presents the possibility of building a city logistics center at the site of the city of Sarajevo, which we received on the basis of the method of assessment of credits offered three alternative sites. After choosing a location to build a city logistic center on the basis of mathematical methods, we calculated the effects of the electric vehicles in terms of driving energy consumption, economic viability and environmental protection between city logistics center Rajlovac-central zone of the city of Sarajevo. The paper will show the comparison of the efficiency of an electric car with respect to classical internal combustion vehicles and an analysis of the influence of classic diesel, petrol and electric motors on the environment for the planned relationship of the city of the logistics center Rajlovac - the central zone of the city of Sarajevo.

AB This paper presents conclusions from a survey among urban freight actors in the four biggest cities in Norway (Oslo, Bergen, Stavanger and Trondheim). The survey focus on logistic operations and transport decisions affecting the city logistics. In the studied cities we found that there is lack of emphasis on urban logistics and urban freight transport planning. The survey indicates that the missing focus on logistic activities is due to lack of co-ordination among actors involved in urban logistics, and often insufficient dialogue between city authorities and private actors who operate in the cities. Representatives from the industries do not always understand the municipal planning processes and on which level of bureaucracy the plans are accomplished.
   To solve challenges a suggestion related to urban logistics and collaboration among private and public actors is to develop structured Urban Logistic Plans. A part of such plans should be the involvement of all stakeholders in the exploitation and processes of development. The stakeholders must also be involved in policy development and strategic planning processes. The survey indicates that congestion and access to centrally located loading and unloading zones are the biggest problem for freight transport in Norwegian urban areas. From the industry, there is a request that loading and unloading zones must be incorporated as part of land use plans.
   It was also stressed that local authorities must include plans for goods deliveries in line with services from taxi and public transport in sustainable urban mobility plans (SUMPs). (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license.

AB Driven by trends as urbanisation and innovative business models in online retailing, e-commerce is experiencing rapid growth. Paired with new customer expectations and increasing labour shortage as well as inefficient last-mile delivery, urban logistic concepts are in need for innovative solutions. Autonomous vehicles delivering shipments in a so-called Van-and-Robot (VnR) concept appear like a promising approach to tackle these hurdles, since limitations of delivery robots regarding speed and range can be compensated, while maintaining flexibility and the ability to bundle shipments. But since this concept was never implemented and requires the integration of two autonomous vehicles, it shows high implementation cost and uncertainties with regard to technical requirements. Therefore, this study aims to analyse the impact of the use of a VnR delivery concept on urban last mile delivery costs. Furthermore, the system-determining parameters with regard to these costs should be defined in order to design an efficient VnR concept usage. These implications should also serve as a guideline for practitioners to support an implementation.

AB (I)n the face of sharp urbanization around the world, metropolitan areas have started different initiatives and projects to make cities more efficient and sustainable. Hereby logistics and transportation activities have a major impact in the development of so called 'Smart Cities'. By addressing complex decision making problems through simulation and optimization, the Operations Research community has contributed to the development of sustainable city logistic systems. While technical and structural problems have been extensively discussed in the literature, many models neglect the importance of behavioral issues arising from risk aversion, stakeholder interaction and human factors that play an important role in the consolidation and optimization of logistical activities. This paper reviews existing work considering behavioral factors from an OR perspective. Simulation and optimization models to major problem settings in City Logistics are discussed and methodologies to conquer real-life urban L&T challenges are presented.
